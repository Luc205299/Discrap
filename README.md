# Discord Server and Message Fetcher

This project allows you to retrieve information from a Discord server, including channels, messages, and user data, and store it in a MySQL database. It also saves the fetched messages in text files within a structured folder for further analysis.

## Features

- **Fetch Server Channels**: Retrieve all the channels within a specific Discord server.
- **Fetch Messages**: Retrieve messages from the channels of a Discord server.
- **User Data**: Fetch detailed user information (username, global name, avatar, etc.) for the authors of the messages.
- **Database Integration**: Store server, channel, message, and user data in a MySQL database.
- **Save Data in Files**: Save the messages and channel data as text files in structured folders.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL server running with a database created for storing the data
- A Discord Bot Token with the necessary permissions (`YOUR DISCORD KEY`)
- Installed libraries: `requests`, `mysql-connector-python`, and `json`

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-server-fetcher.git
   
2. Install Python Libraries:
   You need to install the required Python libraries. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   pip install requests mysql-connector-python
   
3. Configure the Script:
   Open the Python script discord_fetcher.py and do the following:
   ```python
   conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_mysql_host",
    user="your_mysql_user",
    password="your_mysql_password",
    database="discord_data"
   )
   ```
   Replace the YOUR DISCORD KEY with your actual Discord Bot Token in both places within the script:
   ```
   headers = {
    'authorization': 'YOUR DISCORD KEY'
   }
   ```
   Dont forget to adapt the script to your database!!

   ```python
   sql = "INSERT INTO messages (id, content, author_id, name, pseudo_name, channel_id, created_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"
   ```
